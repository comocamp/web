question = "What about **accessibility**? Is it possible to access the event without barriers?"
answer = """
Yes! The large conference room in the basement is accessible via a long and flat steel ramp in the courtyard of the hotel or as an alternative via a stair lift suitable for wheelchairs, which you might prefer in very bad weather conditions. The house also has two sufficiently large elevators with which all other floors can be reached. Regarding the suitability of the hotel rooms for your specific needs, we ask you to contact the Europahaus hotel and clarify the details directly.

[[faq]]
question = "Which kind of **food** do you offer? What if I have special dietary requirements?"
answer = """
After you have bought a ticket, we will ask you to choose your basic preference, ranging from a "classic diet", which might include meat (without pork) to a "vegetarian" or "vegan" diet. On top you are asked to provide your special dietary requirements, which we will transmit to the kitchen, provided we have them **four weeks** before the event. Even though we cannot guarantee that we are able to deal with all your requirements, we promise to do our best.
"""

[[faq]]
question = "Do you have a **code of conduct**? What happens if somebody violates basic rules?"
answer = """
Our simple motto for the camp is **"Be open, be honest, be respectful!"**. If somebody violates these principles in a way that you as a participant find unacceptable for our host, our camp's reputation or a successful event organisation, please bring this to the attention of the [organizers](#team). The team will collectively decide whether a. a violation is occuring and whether b. the violating visitor is given a warning or is excluded from the event.
