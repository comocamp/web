The **ComoCamp** unconference is organized as a large open space. Join us in creating an engaging and dynamic experience where your voice truly matters! We believe that the heart of any open space event lies in the diverse perspectives and knowledge of its participants. That's why we encourage everyone to bring their own topics to the table. Whether it's a burning question, a fascinating idea, or a pressing issue, your input is invaluable in shaping the discussions and fostering meaningful interactions. By contributing your own topics, you help ensure that our open space is a reflection of the collective wisdom and interests of our community. So, come prepared to share, explore, and inspire as we come together to exchange ideas, learn from one another, and co-create a memorable experience.
