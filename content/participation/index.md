Please note that our tickets are non-refundable, but **freely transferable**, in other words there is no very good reason to wait until we are sold out. ðŸ˜‰ You may pay per **credit-card**, but we also offer to pay **by invoice**, feel free to choose this option during your checkout process. And by the way: the tickets do not contain any deductible value added tax (VAT), as the camp is organized by "Collaborate Vienna", a non-profit association registered by austrian law.
