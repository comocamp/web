The Collaborative Modeling Camp (ComoCamp) is an unconference inspired by **Agile Methods**, **Domain-Driven Design** and **Behavior Driven Development**. We reach out to bring practitioners of collaborative modeling methods together with creators and thought leaders. We also invite everybody interested to be part of this event. Experience collaboration, discuss and share your knowledge! Our camp is not-for-profit, hands-on, community-organized, and meant to be a lot of fun.
