Weâ€™re living in great times: After decades of misunderstanding our users, we programmers now have better tools. Collaborative Modeling methods make it easy to build the software our users really need (and not the software we only thought they would need). Among these methods are:

- Event Storming
- User Story Mapping
- Storystorming
- Domain Storytelling
- Event Modeling
- Impact Mapping
- Example Mapping
- and many more.

The CoMoCamp is the great unconference that gathers practioners of all the different methods as well as the inventors behind and thought leaders behind the tools. We invite all interested community members to be part of it. The camp is not-for-profit and community organized.

Among the participants are the German-speaking DDD-community as well as international experts: X, Y and Z.

The CoMoCamp will take place in Park Hotel Soltau June 19th and 20th 2020.
